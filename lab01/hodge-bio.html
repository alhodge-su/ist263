        Hello! My name is Alexandra Hodge. I am currently a double major in graphic design and information management & technology interested in UX/UI design. I was born and raised in New York City and live at home with my mother and younger brother. In my free time I enjoy reading, painting my nails, hanging out with my friends and family, and listening to music. My interests include graphic design, poetry, and art.
