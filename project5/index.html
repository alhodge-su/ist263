        <p>Hello! My name is Alexandra and I have scleroderma.</p>
        <p>If your eyebrow didn’t just furrow in confusion at how that’s pronounced (sklair-oh-DUR-muh), you likely have been impacted by this illness or know someone who does. If it did, I’m here to explain what it is.</p>
        <p>Scleroderma (also as systemic sclerosis) is a rare autoimmune disease that affects your skin, connective tissue, and internal organs. It happens when your immune system causes your body to make too much of the protein collagen, an important part of your skin. Its cause is unknown, and it lacks a cure, but <a href="treatingssc.html">treatment</a> helps many patients adjust to <a href="lifewssc.html">life with the disease.</a></p>
